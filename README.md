# TumorNet: A Diagnostic Aid for Brain MRI Analysis

**TumorNet** is a machine learning project focused on the development of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for automatic detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained to:

- **Identify** the presence or absence of a brain tumor.
- **Classify** the type of tumor into one of the following categories:
  - **Glioma**
  - **Meningioma**
  - **Pituitary**

The goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in **early diagnosis** and improve the **accuracy** and **speed** of medical imaging analysis.

## Key Features:
- Automated tumor detection and classification.
- Works with brain MRI scans to aid in diagnostic decision-making.
- Classification of three types of brain tumors: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary.

## Potential Impact:
This project can help reduce diagnostic errors and enhance the efficiency of brain tumor detection, facilitating quicker, more accurate assessments in medical settings.
