# TumorNet: Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks - A Diagnostic Aid for Brain MRI Analysis

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to automatically detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The model not only identifies the presence or absence of a tumor but also classifies the type of tumor (glioma, meningioma or pituitary). The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, improving the accuracy and speed of medical imaging analysis.
